This README provides an overview of the project management processes used by OctoAcme, along with links to detailed documents in this folder.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme's project management processes foster clear ownership, iterative delivery, and transparent communication across cross-functional teams.

### Project Initiation
Project initiation starts with alignment on the problem statement, success metrics, and key stakeholders. This ensures all team members understand the project's goals and expectations from the outset.

### Core Roles and Personas
- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery and communications across the team
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes and priorities for the project
- **Developers**: Break work into shippable increments and implement features
- **QA Specialists**: Ensure features meet acceptance criteria and quality standards

### Execution and Tracking
Execution is managed through visual workflows (like GitHub Projects) with clearly defined delivery stages:
- Backlog
- Ready
- In Progress
- In Review
- QA
- Done

Pull requests are traceable, with linked issues and clear acceptance criteria. Automated tests, linting, and security scans are standard in CI, and manual QA is performed for feature acceptance.

### Team Rhythm
- Daily standups
- Weekly syncs
- Milestone demos

### Communication Strategies
Communication is multi-layered to ensure transparency and alignment:
- Weekly PM/PdM syncs
- Stakeholder briefings
- Risk register management
- Incident reporting

### Escalation Paths
Escalation paths ensure timely resolution of issues:
1. Team triage
2. PM escalation
3. Sponsor intervention for business-impacting issues

### Quality Assurance Practices
- Automated tests in CI/CD pipeline
- Code linting and security scans
- Manual QA for feature acceptance
- Clear acceptance criteria for all work items

### Continuous Improvement
Continuous improvement is maintained through:
- Regular retrospectives
- Action item tracking
- Integration of team learnings
- Iterative approach to processes

These workflows blend strong role clarity, rigorous quality practices, and open communication, enabling consistent project delivery and ongoing learning.
